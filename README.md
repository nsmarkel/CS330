How do I approach designing software?
 	I approach designing software by utilizing the SDLC. To improve this process, I also keep in mind the customer’s requests. By using the customer’s requests as my requirements, I ensure that the software I ship is what the customer ordered. 

How do I approach developing programs?
	When developing programs I ensure that everything I make is robust and secure. I do this by utilizing tests often and testing for bugs after any changes. This allows me to not get buried by problems and spend less time troubleshooting and more time developing the program. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
	Computer Science is the career field I would like to be employed in eventually. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer that can provide solutions to customers with my knowledge of programming.
